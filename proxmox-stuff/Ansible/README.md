# Ansible Roles and Playbooks

In this folder I share some Ansible playbooks and roles for other people to use.
They are written "quick and dirty" since I do not intend to give them Ansible Galaxy quality.

Please be aware that I do not intent to keep those roles up to date or provide support.
You are free to use them and do whatever you want with it.

I might however update the code if I find time (hard to find sometimes).
